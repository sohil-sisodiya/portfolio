# About Me

I'm Sohil Sisodiya, a data scientist with a strong interest in solving complex problems through data. My work combines analytical thinking, statistical rigor, and a deep curiosity about how things work.

I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Institute of Engg. and Technology, DAVV](https://ietdavv.edu.in/), applying data science to improve systems and support informed decision-making.

## My Approach

I approach data science as both a technical and a communication challenge. A good model means little without interpretability, and insights only matter when they lead to real-world understanding or action. My goal is always to:

- Ask the right questions before jumping to solutions  
- Work with clean, well-understood data  
- Build models that are robust and explainable  
- Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, R  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Tools:** Jupyter, Git, Docker, Tableau, Power BI
- **Techniques:** Regression, classification, clustering, time series, NLP, A/B testing

## Values and Interests

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of data science and [something you're passionate aboutâ€”e.g. public policy, environmental science, education, etc.]. I value transparency, reproducibility, and lifelong learning.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading non-fiction, hiking, exploring new datasets, writing articles.
