# Time and Space Complexity Analysis using Big O

**Time Complexity:** The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. The time required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called _**time complexity**_ of the algorithm.

**Space Complexity:** Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called ***space complexity*** of the algorithm.

## Big O Notation

Big O defines the runtime required to execute an algorithm by identifying how the performance of your algorithm will change as the input size grows. But it does not tell you how fast your algorithm's runtime is.

Big O notation measures the efficiency and performance of your algorithm using time and space complexity.

- **O(1)** - Excellent/Best
- **O(log n)** - Good
- **O(n)** - Fair
- **O(n log n)** - Bad
- **O(n^2)**, **O(2^n)** and **O(n!)** - Horrible/Worst
